Overview

Since projects are being worked on this unit, you won't have a homework assignment, but a project is a perfect context in which to practice writing tests! 

Incorporate a few of the below suggestions into your project. You'll write better code, and it will help you consolidate your testing habits.




Testing Suggestions


Set up Karma so you can run your tests as you develop.
Prior to implementing a feature, use Nightmare to write a functional test for it.
Prior to implementing a function, use Mocha and Chai to write unit tests against it.
Run your tests prior to committing your code so you can be sure nothing breaks between commits.
Non-Obligatory Bonus: If you're confident and feel like you have some time to tinker, set up Travis CI. This will automatically run your tests whenever you or any of your team members makes a commit.
